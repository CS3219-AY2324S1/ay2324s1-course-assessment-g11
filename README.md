    Workspaces is available in Yarn v1.0 and later.

    ```

3. **Node.js:** Check each application's documentation for the recommended
    Node.js version.

### Getting Started - Local Development:

1. **Installing Dependencies:** From the root directory, run:

   ```bash
   cd spa
   yarn install
   ```

   This command will install dependencies for all services and the frontend in a
   centralized `node_modules` directory at the root.

2. **Running Frontend Scripts:** To run the frontend spa, use:

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```
